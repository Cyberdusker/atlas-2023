	"description": "_The five-pointed star white star, also called Stella d'Italia (English: \"Star of Italy\"), is the oldest national symbol of Italy, since it dates back to ancient Greece. In this historical epoch Italy was associated with the Star of Venus because it was located west of the Hellenic peninsula.\n\n_The steel cogwheel represents labour, which is the foundation of the Republic.\n\n_The oak branch, located on the right, symbolizes the strength and dignity of the Italians.\n\nThe olive branch, located instead on the left, represents Italy's will for peace, both internally and vis-Ã -vis other nations.\n\nBoth oak and olive trees are characteristic of the Italian landscape.",
